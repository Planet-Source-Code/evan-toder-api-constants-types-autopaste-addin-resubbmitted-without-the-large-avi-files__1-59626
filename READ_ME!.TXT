!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IN ORDER FOR THIS PROG TO RUN PROPERLY YOU MUST HAVE 
THE TEXT FILE "API.txt" in the same path/folder as
the addin(.dll)  That is because this program works
intimately with that text file and requres its contents
throughout the usage of the program 

===============================================================================


THIS PROGRAM IS A VB ADDIN THAT SIMPLIFIES AND QUICKENS THE 
PROCESS OF INSERTING API DECLARATIONS AS WELL AS THEIR ASSOCIATED
CONSTANTS AND TYPES IN YOUR PROJECT.

HERE IS HOW IT WORKS:

1) FOR API DECLARATION INSERTION:
 
   type out the api call i.e   "setwindowpos"
   (without the quotes) 
   select or highlight the call with your mouse 
   cursor, and with the left button still pressed
   down hit the "a" key on the keyboard.
   
2) FOR CONSTANTS INSERTION
   
  (a) if you know the constants you want

   type out the first 3 letters ( or more) of
   the constant(s) you wish to insert.
   For example..say you've just inserted the 
   api call  "DrawText" which requires at least
   on of the constants prefixed with "DT_
   i.e "DT_LEFT  or  "DT_SINGLELINE"
   Type out "dt_" (without the quotes)
   select it with your mouse and with the left 
   button still down hit the "c" key
   select the constants you desire from the
   alphabetical list

  (b) If your unsure of the constants you want
   
    with the left mouse button pressed anywhere
    in the code window
    hit the "c" key
    select the constants you desire from the
    alphabetical list

3) FOR TYPE INSERTION

   (a) if you know the type you desire

    type out the entire types name i.e. "pointapi"
    (without the quotes) 
    select it with your mouse, with the left button
    still down hit the "t" key, confirm your selection

   (b) if your usure of the constants you desire

    with the left mouse button depressed anywhere
